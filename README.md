vlclib binding in RED
This is my attempt (and success) at creating a vlclib binding for RED. This lets you play videos with Red using that library. It's not perfect but it works.
You will need to download VLC and install it. In addition to the libvlc.dll you will also need the "plugins" folder to be copied to the folder you are running your Red program from.
